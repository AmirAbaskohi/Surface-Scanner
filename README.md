# Surface Scanner
An android application using java and Gradle for Cyber Physical Systems course.

Surface scanning is a non-invasive method to capture the shape, texture and volume information of a three-dimensional object. In terms of accuracy, it can be as accurate as micro-tomography. Yet, it does not involve any exposure to ionizing radiation.

## How it works?
This is an Android application which you can build it using `Android Studio`. The application uses `accelometer` and `geroscope` to detect movement in `z` and `y` directions.
